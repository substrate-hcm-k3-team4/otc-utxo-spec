.. _data-model:

Data Model
----------

The BTC-Relay, as opposed to Bitcoin SPV clients, only stores a subset of information contained in block headers and does not store transactions. 
Specifically, only data that is absolutely necessary to perform correct verification of block headers and transaction inclusion is stored. 

Note that the structs used to represent bitcoin transactions and blocks is slightly different from the :ref:`bitcoin-data-model`. For example, no ``tx_in count`` is required, since this information is implicitly stored in the vector of inputs.

Types
~~~~~

.. _RawBlockHeader:

RawBlockHeader
..............

An 80 bytes long Bitcoin blockchain header, according to the format as specified by the `Bitcoin reference <https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/block_chain.html>`_.

Constants
~~~~~~~~~

DIFFICULTY_ADJUSTMENT_INTERVAL
..............................

The interval in number of blocks at which Bitcoin adjusts its difficulty (approx. every 2 weeks = 2016 blocks).


TARGET_TIMESPAN
...............

Expected duration of the different adjustment interval in seconds, ``1209600`` seconds (two weeks) in the case of Bitcoin.


TARGET_TIMESPAN_DIVISOR
.......................

Auxiliary constant used in Bitcoin's difficulty re-target mechanism. 

   
UNROUNDED_MAX_TARGET
....................

The maximum difficulty target, :math:`2^{224}-1` in the case of Bitcoin. For more information, see the `Bitcoin Wiki <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Target>`_.


MAIN_CHAIN_ID
.............

Identifier of the Bitcoin main chain tracked in the ``ChainsIndex`` mapping. At any point in time, the ``BlockChain`` with this identifier is considered to be the main chain and will be used to transaction inclusion verification.

STABLE_BITCOIN_CONFIRMATIONS
............................

Global security parameter (typically referred to as ``k`` in scientific literature), determining the umber of confirmations (in blocks) necessary for a transaction to be considered "stable" in Bitcoin. Stable thereby means that the probability of the transaction being excluded from the blockchain due to a fork is negligible. 

STABLE_PARACHAIN_CONFIRMATIONS
..............................

Global security parameter (typically referred to as ``k`` in scientific literature), determining the umber of confirmations (in blocks) necessary for a transaction to be considered "stable" in the BTC Parachain. Stable thereby means that the probability of the transaction being excluded from the blockchain due to a fork is negligible. 

.. note:: We use this to enforce a minimum delay on Bitcoin block header acceptance in the BTC-Parachain in cases where a (large) number of block headers are submitted as a batch.

Structs
~~~~~~~
  
.. _BlockHeader:

BlockHeader
...........

Representation of a Bitcoin block header, constructed by the parachain from the :ref:`RawBlockHeader`. The main differences compared to the :ref:`bitcoinBlockHeader` in :ref:`bitcoin-data-model` is that this contains the unpacked ``target`` constructed from ``nBits``, and an additional ``hash`` of the ``BlockHeader`` for convenience.

.. note:: Fields marked as [Optional] are not critical for the secure operation of BTC-Relay, but can be stored anyway, at the developers discretion. We omit these fields in the rest of this specification.

Data Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BlockHeaders
............

Mapping of ``<blockHash, RichBlockHeader>``, storing all verified Bitcoin block headers (fork and main chain) submitted to BTC-Relay.


.. _Chains: 

Chains
.........

Level of indirection over :ref:`ChainsIndex`, i.e. the values stored in this map are keys of ``ChainsIndex``. ``Chains[0]`` MUST always be ``0``, such that ``ChainsIndex[Chains[0]]`` is the bitcoin *main chain*. The remaining items MUST sort the chains by height, i.e. it MUST hold that for each ``0 < i < j``, ``ChainsIndex[Chains[i]].maxHeight >= ChainsIndex[Chains[j]].maxHeight``. Furthermore, keys MUST be consecutive, i.e. for each ``i``, if ``Chains[i]`` does not exist, ``Chains[i+1]`` MUST NOT exist either. 

.. note:: The assumption for ``Chains`` is that, in the majority of cases, block headers will be appended to the *main chain* (longest chain), i.e., the ``BlockChain`` entry at the most significant position in the queue/heap. Similarly, transaction inclusion proofs (:ref:`verifyTransactionInclusion`) are only checked against the *main chain*. This means, in the average case lookup complexity will be O(1). Furthermore, block headers can only be appended if they (i) have a valid PoW and (ii) do not yet exist in ``BlockHeaders`` - hence, spamming is very costly and unlikely. Finally, blockchain forks and re-organizations occur infrequently, especially in Bitcoin. In principle, optimizing lookup costs should be prioritized, ideally O(1), while inserting of new items and re-balancing can even be O(n). 


.. _ChainsIndex: 

ChainsIndex
...........

The main storage map of ``BlockChain`` structs, indexed by a *values* from the :ref:`Chains`. ``ChainsIndex[0]`` MUST always contain the main chain.


BestBlock
.........

32 byte Bitcoin block hash (double SHA256) identifying the current blockchain tip, i.e., the ``RichBlockHeader`` with the highest ``blockHeight`` in the ``BlockChain`` entry, which has the most significant ``height`` in the ``Chains`` priority queue (topmost position). 


.. note:: Bitcoin uses SHA256 (32 bytes) for its block hashes, transaction identifiers and Merkle trees. In Substrate, we hence use ``H256`` to represent these hashes.

BestBlockHeight
...............

Integer representing the maximum block height (``height``) in the ``Chains`` priority queue. This is also the ``blockHeight`` of the ``RichBlockHeader`` entry pointed to by ``BestBlock``.


ChainCounter
.................

Integer increment-only counter used to track existing BlockChain entries.
Initialized with 1 (0 is reserved for ``MAIN_CHAIN_ID``).
