Replace
=======

Overview
~~~~~~~~~

The Replace module allows a Vault (*oldVault*) to be replaced by transferring the BTC it is holding locked to another Vault (*newVault*)
which provides the necessary DOT collateral. The DOT collateral of the *oldVault*, corresponding to the amount of replaced BTC, is then unlocked.
The *oldVault* must provide griefing collateral for spam protection which is paid to *newVault* on failure.

The *oldVault* is responsible for ensuring that it has sufficient BTC to pay for the transaction fees.

Conceptually, the Replace protocol resembles a SPV atomic cross-chain swap.

Step-by-Step
-------------

1. Precondition: a Vault (*oldVault*) has locked DOT collateral in the :ref:`vault-registry` and has issued interBTC tokens - i.e., holds BTC on Bitcoin.

2. *oldVault* submits a replace request, indicating how much BTC is to be migrated by calling the :ref:`requestReplace` function. 

   * *oldVault* is required to lock some amount of DOT collateral (:ref:`replaceGriefingCollateral`) as griefing protection, to prevent *oldVault* from holding *newVault*'s DOT collateral locked in the BTC Parachain without ever finalizing the redeem protocol (transfer of BTC). 

3. Optional: *oldVault* can withdraw the request by calling the :ref:`withdrawReplace` function with a specified amount. For example, if *oldVault* requested a replacement for 10 tokens, and 2 tokens have been accepted by some *newVault*, then it can withdraw up to 8 tokens from being replaced. 

4. A new candidate Vault (*newVault*), commits to accepting the replacement by locking up the necessary DOT collateral to back the to-be-transferred BTC (according to the :ref:`secureCollateralThreshold`) by calling the :ref:`acceptReplace` function.

   * Note: from the *oldVault*'s perspective a redeem is very similar to an accepted replace. That is, its goal is to get rid of tokens, and it is not important if this is achieved by a user redeeming, or by a Vault accepting the replace request. As such, when a user requests a redeem with a Vault that has requested a replacement, the *oldVault*'s ``toBeReplacedTokens`` is decreased by the amount of tokens redeemed by the user.

5. Within a pre-defined delay, *oldVault* must release the BTC on Bitcoin to *newVault*'s BTC address, and submit a valid transaction inclusion proof by calling the :ref:`executeReplace` function (call to ``verifyTransactionInclusion`` in :ref:`btc_relay`). If *oldVault* releases the BTC to *newVault* correctly and submits the transaction inclusion proof to Replace module on time, *oldVault*'s DOT collateral is released - *newVault* has now replaced *oldVault*.

   * Note: as with redeems, to prevent *oldVault* from trying to re-use old transactions (or other payments to *newVaults* on Bitcoin) as fake proofs, we require *oldVault* to include a ``nonce`` in an OP_RETURN output of the transfer transaction on Bitcoin.

6. Optional: If *oldVault* fails to provide the correct transaction inclusion proof on time, the *newVault*'s ``collateral`` is unlocked and *oldVault*'s ``griefingCollateral`` is sent to the *newVault* as reimbursement for the opportunity costs of locking up DOT collateral via the :ref:`cancelReplace`. 

Security
--------

- Unique identification of Bitcoin payments: :ref:`op-return`


Vault Registry
--------------

The data access and state changes to the :ref:`vault-registry` are documented in :numref:`fig-vault-registry-replace` below.

.. _fig-vault-registry-replace:
.. figure:: ../figures/spec/VaultRegistry-Replace.png
    :alt: Vault-Registry Replace
    
    The replace module interacts with functions in the Vault-Registry to handle updating token balances of vaults. The green lines indicate an increase, the red lines a decrease.

Fee Model
---------

- If a replace request is cancelled, the griefing collateral is transferred to the *newVault*.
- If a replace request is executed, the griefing collateral is transferred to the *oldVault*.

Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~

Scalars
-------

ReplaceBtcDustValue
...................

The minimum amount a *newVault* can accept - this is to ensure the *oldVault* is able to make the Bitcoin transfer. Furthermore, it puts a limit on the transaction fees that the *oldVault* needs to pay.

.. _ReplacePeriod:

ReplacePeriod
.............

The time difference between a replace request is accepted by another Vault and the transfer of BTC (and submission of the transaction inclusion proof) by the to-be-replaced Vault. Concretely, this period is the amount by which :ref:`activeBlockCount` is allowed to increase before the redeem is considered to be expired. The replace period has an upper limit to prevent griefing of Vault collateral. Each accepted replace request records the value of this field upon creation, and when checking the expiry, the maximum of the current ReplacePeriod and the value as recorded in the ReplaceRequest is used. This way, vaults are not negatively impacted by a change in the value.


Maps
----

ReplaceRequests
...............

Vaults create replace requests if they want to have (a part of) their DOT collateral to be replaced by other Vaults. This mapping provides access from a unique hash ``ReplaceId`` to a ``ReplaceRequest`` struct. ``<ReplaceId, Replace>``.


Structs
-------

Replace
.......

Stores the status and information about a single replace request.
