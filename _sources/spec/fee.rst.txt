Fee
===

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The fee model crate implements the fee model outlined in :ref:`fee_model`.

Step-by-step
------------

1. Fees are paid by Users (e.g., during issue and redeem requests) and forwarded to a reward pool.
2. Fees are then split between incentivised network participants (i.e. Vaults).
3. Network participants can claim these rewards from the pool based on their stake.
4. Stake is determined by their participation in the network - through incentivized actions.
5. Rewards are paid in ``interBTC``.
