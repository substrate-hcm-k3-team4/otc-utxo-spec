.. _storage-verification:

Functions: Storage and Verification
===================================

.. _initialize:

initialize
----------

Initializes BTC-Relay with the first Bitcoin block to be tracked and initializes all data structures (see :ref:`data-model`).

.. note:: BTC-Relay **does not** have to be initialized with Bitcoin's genesis block! The first block to be tracked can be selected freely. 

.. warning:: Caution when setting the first block in BTC-Relay: only succeeding blocks can be submitted and **predecessors and blocks from other chains will be rejected**! Similarly, caution is required with the initial block height argument, since if an incorrect value is used, all subsequently reported block heights will be incorrect.


Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Function Signature*

``initialize(relayer, rawBlockHeader, blockHeight)``

*Parameters*

* ``relayer``: the account submitting the block
* ``rawBlockHeader``: 80 byte raw Bitcoin block header, see :ref:`RawBlockHeader`.
* ``blockHeight``: integer Bitcoin block height of the submitted block header 

*Events*

* ``Initialized(blockHeight, blockHash, relayer)``: if the first block header was stored successfully, emit an event with the stored block's height (``blockHeight``) and the (PoW) block hash (``blockHash``).

*Errors*

* ``ERR_ALREADY_INITIALIZED = "Already initialized"``: return error if this function is called after BTC-Relay has already been initialized.

*Preconditions*

* This is the first time this function is called, i.e., when BTC-Relay is being deployed. 
* The blockheader MUST be parsable.
* ``blockHeight`` MUST match the height on the bitcoin chain. Note that the parachain can not check this - it's the caller's responsability!
* ``rawBlockHeader`` MUST match a block on the bitcoin main chain. Note that the parachain can not check this - it's the caller's responsability!
* ``rawBlockHeader`` MUST be a block mined after December 2015 - see :ref:`bitcoinBlockHeader`. This is NOT checked by the parachain - it's the caller's responsibility!

*Postconditions*

Let ``blockHeader`` be the parsed ``rawBlockHeader``. Then:

* ``ChainsIndex[0]`` MUST be set to a new ``BlockChain`` value, where ``BlockChain.chainId = 0`` and``BlockChain.startHeight = BlockChain.maxHeight = blockHeight``
* A value ``block`` of type ``RichBlockHeader`` MUST be added to ``BlockHeaders``, where:
  
  * ``block.basic_block_header = blockHeader``
  * ``block.chainRef = 0``
  * ``block.paraHeight`` is the current activeBlockCount (see the Security module)
  * ``block.blockHeight = blockHeight``

* ``BestBlockHeight`` MUST be ``ChainsIndex[0].maxHeight``
* ``BestBlock`` MUST be ``blockHeader.hash``
* ``StartBlockHeight`` MUST be set to ``blockHeight``
  

.. _storeBlockHeader:

storeBlockHeader
----------------

Method to submit block headers to the BTC-Relay. This function calls :ref:`verifyBlockHeader` to check that the block header is valid. If so, from the block header and stores the hash, height and Merkle tree root of the given block header in ``BlockHeaders``.
If the block header extends an existing ``BlockChain`` entry in ``Chains``, it appends the block hash to the ``chains`` mapping and increments the ``maxHeight``. Otherwise, a new ``Blockchain`` entry is created.

Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Function Signature*

``storeBlockHeader(relayer, rawBlockHeader)``

*Parameters*

* ``relayer``: the account submitting the block
* ``rawBlockHeader``: 80 byte raw Bitcoin block header, see :ref:`RawBlockHeader`.

*Events*

* ``StoreMainChainHeader(blockHeight, blockHash, relayer)``: if the block header was successful appended to the currently longest chain (*main chain*) emit an event with the stored block's height (``blockHeight``) and the (PoW) block hash (``blockHash``).
* ``StoreForkHeader(forkId, blockHeight, blockHash, relayer)``: if the block header was successful appended to a new or existing fork, emit an event with the block height (``blockHeight``) and the (PoW) block hash (``blockHash``).

*Invariants*

* The values in ``Chains`` MUST be such that for each ``0 < i < j``, ``ChainsIndex[Chains[i]].maxHeight >= ChainsIndex[Chains[j]].maxHeight``.
* The keys in ``Chains`` MUST be consecutive, i.e. for each ``i``, if ``Chains[i]`` does not exist, ``Chains[i+1]`` MUST NOT exist either. 
* The keys in ``ChainsIndex`` MUST be consecutive, i.e. for each ``i``, if ``ChainsIndex[i]`` does not exist, ``ChainsIndex[i+1]`` MUST NOT exist either. 
* For all ``i > 0`` the following MUST hold: `ChainsIndex[i].maxHeight < ChainsIndex[0].maxHeight + STABLE_BITCOIN_CONFIRMATIONS`.
* For all ``i``, the following MUST hold: ``ChainsIndex[i].chainRef == i``.
* ``BestBlock.chainRef`` MUST be 0
* ``BestBlock.blockHeight`` MUST be ``ChainsIndex[0].maxHeight``
* ``BestBlockHeight`` MUST be ``ChainsIndex[0].maxHeight``

*Preconditions*

* The BTC Parachain status MUST NOT be set to ``SHUTDOWN: 3``.
* The given ``rawBlockHeader`` MUST parse be parsable into ``blockHeader``.
* There MUST be a block header ``prevHeader`` stored in ``BlockHeaders`` with a hash equal to ``blockHeader.hashPrevBlock``.
* A block chain ``prevBlockchain`` MUST be stored in ``ChainsIndex[prevHeader.chainRef]``.
* :ref:`VerifyBlockHeader` MUST return ``Ok`` when called with ``blockHeader``, ``prevHeader.blockHeight + 1`` and ``prevHeader``.
* If ``prevHeader`` is the last element a chain (i.e. ``blockHeader`` does not create a new fork), then:
   * ``prevBlockChain`` MUST NOT already contain a block of height ``prevHeader.blockHeight + 1``.
   * If ``prevBlockChain.chain_id`` is _not_ zero (i.e. the block is being added to a fork rather than the main chain), and the fork is ``STABLE_BITCOIN_CONFIRMATIONS`` blocks ahead of the main chain, then calling :ref:`swapMainBlockchain` with this fork MUST return ``Ok``.

*Postconditions*

* If ``prevHeader`` is the last element a chain (i.e. ``blockHeader`` does not create a new fork), then:

  *  ``ChainsHashes[prevBlockChain.chain_id, prevHeader.blockHeight + 1]`` MUST be set to ``blockHeader.hash``.
  *  ``ChainsIndex[prevBlockChain.chain_id].max_height`` MUST be increased by 1.

  * If ``prevBlockChain.chain_id`` is zero (i.e. the a block is being added to the main chain), then:
  
    * ``BestBlock`` MUST be set to ``blockHeader.hash``
    * ``BestBlockHeight`` MUST be set to ``prevHeader.blockHeight + 1``
    
  * If ``prevBlockChain.chain_id`` is _not_ zero (i.e. the block is being added to a fork rather than the main chain), then:

    * If the fork is ``STABLE_BITCOIN_CONFIRMATIONS`` blocks ahead of the main chain, i.e. ``prevHeader.blockHeight + 1 >= BestBlockHeight + STABLE_BITCOIN_CONFIRMATIONS``, then the fork is moved to the mainchain. That is, :ref:`swapMainBlockchain` MUST be called with the fork as argument.

  * A new ``RichBlockHeader`` MUST be stored in ``BlockHeaders`` that is constructed as follows:

    * ``RichBlockHeader.blockHeader = blockHeader``,
    * ``RichBlockHeader.blockHeight = prevBlock.blockHeight + 1``,
    * ``RichBlockHeader.chainRef = prevBlockChain.chainId``,
    * ``RichBlockHeader.paraHeight`` is set to the current active block count - see the security module for details

* If ``prevHeader`` is *not* the last element a chain (i.e. ``blockHeader`` creates a *new* fork), then:

  * ``ChainCounter`` MUST be incremented. Let ``newChainCounter`` be the incremented value, then
  * ``ChainsHashes[newChainCounter, prevHeader.blockHeight + 1]`` MUST be set  to ``blockHeader.hash``.
  * A new blockchain MUST be inserted into ``ChainsIndex``. Let ``newChain`` be the newly inserted chain. Then ``newChain`` MUST have the following values:

    * ``newChain.chainId = newChainCounter``,
    * ``newChain.startHeight = prevHeader.blockHeight + 1``,
    * ``newChain.maxHeight = prevHeader.blockHeight + 1``,

  * A new value MUST be added to ``Chains`` that is equal to ``newChainCounter`` in a way that maintains the invariants specified above.
  * A new ``RichBlockHeader`` MUST be stored in ``BlockHeaders`` that is constructed as follows:

    * ``RichBlockHeader.blockHeader = blockHeader``,
    * ``RichBlockHeader.blockHeight = newChain.blockHeight + 1``,
    * ``RichBlockHeader.chainRef = prevBlockChain.chainId``,
    * ``RichBlockHeader.paraHeight`` is set to the current active block count - see the security module for details

* ``BestBlockHeight`` MUST be set to ``Chains[0].max_height``
* ``BestBlock`` MUST be set to ``ChainsHashes[0, Chains[0].max_height``

.. warning:: The BTC-Relay does not necessarily have the same view of the Bitcoin blockchain as the user's local Bitcoin client. This can happen if (i) the BTC-Relay is under attack, (ii) the BTC-Relay is out of sync, or, similarly, (iii) if the user's local Bitcoin client is under attack or out of sync (see :ref:`security`). 

.. note:: The 80 bytes block header can be retrieved from the `bitcoin-rpc client <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list>`_ by calling the `getBlock <https://bitcoin-rpc.github.io/en/doc/0.17.99/rpc/blockchain/getblock/>`_ and setting verbosity to ``0`` (``getBlock <blockHash> 0``).


.. _swapMainBlockchain:

swapMainBlockchain
------------------

Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Function Signature*

``swapMainBlockchain(fork)``

*Parameters*

* ``fork``: pointer to a ``BlockChain`` entry in ``Chains``. 

*Preconditions*

* ``fork`` is ``STABLE_BITCOIN_CONFIRMATIONS`` blocks ahead of the main chain, i.e. ``fork.maxHeight >= BestBlockHeight + STABLE_BITCOIN_CONFIRMATIONS``

*Postconditions*

Let ``lastBlock`` be the last rich block header in ``fork``, i.e. the blockheader for which ``lastBlock.blockHeight == fork.maxHeight`` and ``lastBlock.chainRef == fork.chainId`` holds. Then: 

* Each ancestor ``a`` of ``lastBlock`` MUST move to the main chain, i.e. ``a.chainRef`` MUST be set to ``MAIN_CHAIN_ID``. 
* ``ChainsIndex[MAIN_CHAIN_ID].maxHeight`` MUST be set to ``lastBlock.blockHeight``.
* Each fork ``fork`` except the main chain that contains an ancestor of ``lastBlock`` MUST set ``fork.startHeight`` to the lowest ``blockHeight`` in the fork that is not an ancestor of ``lastBlock``.
* Each block ``b`` in the mainchain that is not an acestor of ``lastBlock`` MUST move to ``prevBlockChain``, i.e. ``b.chainRef = prevBlockChain.chainId``. 
* ``prevBlockChain.startHeight`` MUST be set to the lowest ``blockHeight`` of all blocks ``b`` that have ``b.chainRef == prevBlockChain.chainId``.
* ``prevBlockChain.maxHeight`` MUST be set to the highest ``blockHeight`` of all blocks ``b`` that have ``b.chainRef == prevBlockChain.chainId``.

The figure below ilustrates an example execution of this function.

.. _verifyBlockHeader:

verifyBlockHeader
-----------------

The ``verifyBlockHeader`` function verifies Bitcoin block headers. It returns ``Ok`` if the blockheader is valid, otherwise an error.

.. note:: This function does not check whether the submitted block header extends the main chain or a fork. This check is performed in :ref:`storeBlockHeader`.

Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Function Signature*

``verifyBlockHeader(blockHeader, blockHeight, prevBlockHeader)``

*Parameters*

* ``blockHeader``: the :ref:`BlockHeader` to check.
* ``blockHeight``: height of the block.
* ``prevBlockHeader``: the :ref:`RichBlockHeader` that is the block header's predecessor.

*Returns*

* ``Ok(())`` if all checks pass successfully, otherwise an error.

*Errors*

* ``ERR_DUPLICATE_BLOCK = "Block already stored"``: return error if the submitted block header is already stored in BTC-Relay (duplicate PoW ``blockHash``). 
* ``ERR_LOW_DIFF = "PoW hash does not meet difficulty target of header"``: return error when the header's ``blockHash`` does not meet the ``target`` specified in the block header.
* ``ERR_DIFF_TARGET_HEADER = "Incorrect difficulty target specified in block header"``: return error if the ``target`` specified in the block header is incorrect for its block height (difficulty re-target not executed).

*Preconditions*

* A block with the ``blockHeader.hash`` MUST NOT already have been stored.
* ``blockHeader.hash`` MUST be be below ``BlockHeader.target``
* ``blockHeader.target`` MUST match the expected target, which is calculated based on previous targets and timestamps. See `the Bitcoin Wiki <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty>`_ for more information. 

*Postconditions*

* ``Ok(())`` MUST be returned.

.. _verifyTransactionInclusion:

verifyTransactionInclusion
--------------------------

The ``verifyTransactionInclusion`` function is one of the core components of the BTC-Relay: this function checks if a given transaction was indeed included in a given block (as stored in ``BlockHeaders`` and tracked by ``Chains``), by reconstructing the Merkle tree root (given a Merkle proof). Also checks if sufficient confirmations have passed since the inclusion of the transaction (considering the current state of the BTC-Relay ``Chains``).

Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Function Signature*

``verifyTransactionInclusion(txId, merkleProof, confirmations, insecure)``

*Parameters*

* ``txId``: 32 byte hash identifier of the transaction.
* ``merkleProof``: Merkle tree path (concatenated LE sha256 hashes, dynamic sized).
* ``confirmations``: integer number of confirmation required.

.. note:: The Merkle proof for a Bitcoin transaction can be retrieved using the ``bitcoin-rpc`` `gettxoutproof <https://bitcoin-rpc.github.io/en/doc/0.17.99/rpc/blockchain/gettxoutproof/>`_ method and dropping the first 170 characters. The Merkle proof thereby consists of a list of SHA256 hashes, as well as an indicator in which order the hash concatenation is to be applied (left or right).

*Returns*

* ``True``: if the given ``txId`` appears in at the position specified by ``txIndex`` in the transaction Merkle tree of the block at height ``blockHeight`` and sufficient confirmations have passed since inclusion.
* Error otherwise.

*Events*

* ``VerifyTransaction(txId, txBlockHeight, confirmations)``: if verification was successful, emit an event specifying the ``txId``, the ``blockHeight`` and the requested number of ``confirmations``.

*Errors*

* ``ERR_SHUTDOWN = "BTC Parachain has shut down"``: the BTC Parachain has been shutdown by a manual intervention of the Governance Mechanism.
* ``ERR_MALFORMED_TXID = "Malformed transaction identifier"``: return error if the transaction identifier (``txId``) is malformed.
* ``ERR_CONFIRMATIONS = "Transaction has less confirmations than requested"``: return error if the block in which the transaction specified by ``txId`` was included has less confirmations than requested.
* ``ERR_INVALID_MERKLE_PROOF = "Invalid Merkle Proof"``: return error if the Merkle proof is malformed or fails verification (does not hash to Merkle root).
* ``ERR_ONGOING_FORK = "Verification disabled due to ongoing fork"``: return error if the ``mainChain`` is not at least ``STABLE_BITCOIN_CONFIRMATIONS`` ahead of the next best fork. 

Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The BTC Parachain status must not be set to ``SHUTDOWN: 3``. If ``SHUTDOWN`` is set, all transaction verification is disabled.


Function Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Check that ``txId`` is 32 bytes long. Return ``ERR_MALFORMED_TXID`` error if this check fails. 

2. Check that the current ``BestBlockHeight`` exceeds ``txBlockHeight`` by the requested confirmations.  Return ``ERR_CONFIRMATIONS`` if this check fails. 

  a. If ``insecure == True``, check against user-defined ``confirmations`` only

  b. If ``insecure == True``, check against ``max(confirmations, STABLE_BITCOIN_CONFIRMATIONS)``.

3. Check if the Bitcoin block was stored for a sufficient number of blocks (on the parachain) to ensure that staked relayers had the time to flag the block as potentially invalid. Check performed against ``STABLE_PARACHAIN_CONFIRMATIONS``.

4. Extract the block header from ``BlockHeaders`` using the ``blockHash`` tracked in ``Chains`` at the passed ``txBlockHeight``.  

5. Check that the first 32 bytes of ``merkleProof`` are equal to the ``txId`` and the last 32 bytes are equal to the ``merkleRoot`` of the specified block header. Also check that the ``merkleProof`` size is either exactly 32 bytes, or is 64 bytes or more and a power of 2. Return ``ERR_INVALID_MERKLE_PROOF`` if one of these checks fails.

6. Call :ref:`computeMerkle` passing ``txId``, ``txIndex`` and ``merkleProof`` as parameters. 

  a. If this call returns the ``merkleRoot``, emit a ``VerifyTransaction(txId, txBlockHeight, confirmations)`` event and return ``True``.
  
  b. Otherwise return ``ERR_INVALID_MERKLE_PROOF``.

Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The BTC Parachain status must not be set to ``SHUTDOWN: 3``. If ``SHUTDOWN`` is set, all transaction validation is disabled.

Function Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the `raw Transaction Format section in the Bitcoin Developer Reference <https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#raw-transaction-format>`_ for a full specification of Bitcoin's transaction format (and how to extract inputs, outputs etc. from the raw transaction format). 

1. Extract the ``outputs`` from ``rawTx`` using :ref:`extractOutputs`.

  a. Check that the transaction (``rawTx``) has at least 2 outputs. One output (*Payment UTXO*) must be a `P2PKH <https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Pay-to-Pubkey_Hash>`_ or `P2WPKH <https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/wiki/P2WPKH-Transactions>`_ output. Another output (*Data UTXO*) must be an `OP_RETURN <https://bitcoin.org/en/transactions-guide#term-null-data>`_ output. Raise ``ERR_TX_FORMAT`` if this check fails.

2. Extract the value of the *Payment UTXO* using :ref:`extractOutputValue` and check that it is equal (or greater) than ``paymentValue``. Return ``ERR_INSUFFICIENT_VALUE`` if this check fails. 

3. Extract the Bitcoin address specified as recipient in the *Payment UTXO* using :ref:`extractOutputAddress` and check that it matches ``recipientBtcAddress``. Return ``ERR_WRONG_RECIPIENT`` if this check fails, or the error returned by :ref:`extractOutputAddress` (if the output was malformed).

4. Extract the OP_RETURN value from the *Data UTXO* using :ref:`extractOPRETURN` and check that it matches ``opReturnId``. Return ``ERR_INVALID_OPRETURN`` error if this check fails, or the error returned by :ref:`extractOPRETURN` (if the output was malformed).

.. _verifyAndValidateTransaction:

verifyAndValidateTransaction
----------------------------
