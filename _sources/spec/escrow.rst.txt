Escrow
======

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The Escrow module allows users to lockup tokens in exchange for a non-fungible voting asset. The total "power" of this asset decays linearly as the lock approaches expiry - calculated based on the block height. Historic points for the linear function are recorded each time a user's balance is adjusted which allows us to re-construct voting power at a particular point in time.

This architecture was adopted from Curve, see: `Vote-Escrowed CRV (veCRV) <https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html>`_.

.. note::
    This specification is still a Work-in-Progress (WIP), some information may be outdated or incomplete.

Step-by-step
------------

1. A user may lock any amount of defined governance currency (KINT on Kintsugi, INTR on Interlay) up to a maximum lock period.
2. Both the amount and the unlock time may be increased to improve voting power.
3. The user may unlock their fungible asset after the lock has expired.
