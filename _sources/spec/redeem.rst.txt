Redeem
======

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The redeem module allows a user to receive BTC on the Bitcoin chain in return for destroying an equivalent amount of interBTC on the BTC Parachain. The process is initiated by a user requesting a redeem with a vault. The vault then needs to send BTC to the user within a given time limit. Next, the vault has to finalize the process by providing a proof to the BTC Parachain that they have send the right amount of BTC to the user. If the vault fails to deliver a valid proof within the time limit, the user can claim an equivalent amount of DOT from the vault's locked collateral to reimburse him for his loss in BTC.

Moreover, as part of the liquidation procedure, users are able to directly exchange interBTC for DOT. To this end, a user is able to execute a special liquidation redeem if one or multiple vaults have been liquidated.

Step-by-step
------------

1. Precondition: A user owns interBTC.
2. A user locks an amount of interBTC by calling the :ref:`requestRedeem` function. In this function call, the user selects a vault to execute the redeem request from the list of vaults. The function creates a redeem request with a unique hash.
3. The selected vault listens for the ``RequestRedeem`` event emitted by the user. The vault then proceeds to transfer BTC to the address specified by the user in the :ref:`requestRedeem` function including a unique hash in the ``OP_RETURN`` of one output.
4. The vault executes the :ref:`executeRedeem` function by providing the Bitcoin transaction from step 3 together with the redeem request identifier within the time limit. If the function completes successfully, the locked interBTC are destroyed and the user received its BTC.
5. Optional: If the user could not receive BTC within the given time (as required in step 4), the user calls :ref:`cancelRedeem` after the redeem time limit. The user can choose either to reimburse, or to retry. In case of reimbursement, the user transfer ownership of the tokens to the vault, but receives collateral in exchange. In case of retry, the user gets back its tokens. In either case, the user is given some part of the vault's collateral as compensation for the inconvenience.

   a. Optional: If during a :ref:`cancelRedeem` the user selects reimbursement, and as a result the vault becomes undercollateralized, then vault does not receive the user's tokens - they are burned, and the vault's ``issuedTokens`` decreases. When, at some later point, it gets sufficient colalteral, it can call :ref:`mintTokensForReimbursedRedeem` to get the tokens.

Vault Registry
--------------

The data access and state changes to the vault registry are documented in :numref:`fig-vault-registry-redeem` below.

    :alt: vault-registry-redeem

    The redeem module interacts through three different functions with the vault registry. The green arrow indicate an increase, the red arrows a decrease.

Fee Model
---------

When the user makes a redeem request for a certain amount, it will actually not receive that amount of BTC. This is because there are two types of fees subtracted. First, in order to be able to pay the bitcoin transaction cost, the vault is given a budget to spend on on the bitcoin inclusion fee, based on :ref:`RedeemTransactionSize` and the inclusion fee estimates reported by the oracle. The actual amount spent on the inclusion fee is not checked. If the vault does not spend the whole budget, it can keep the surplus, although it will not be able to spend it without being liquidated for theft. It may at some point want to withdraw all of its collateral and then to move its bitcoin into a new account. The second fee that the user pays for is the parachain fee that goes to the fee pool to incentivize the various participants in the system.

The main accounting changes of a successful redeem is summarized below. See the individual functions for more details.

  - ``redeem.amountBTC`` bitcoin is transferred to the user.
  - ``redeem.amountBTC + redeem.fee + redeem.transferFeeBTC`` is burned from the user.
  - The vault's ``issuedTokens`` decreases by ``redeem.amountBTC + redeem.transferFeeBTC``.
  - The fee pool content increases by ``redeem.fee`` (if non-zero).
  - If the vault self-redeems (the redeemer is the vault ID) no fee is paid.



Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~

Scalars
-------


.. _RedeemPeriod:

RedeemPeriod
............

The time difference between when an redeem request is created and required completion time by a vault. Concretely, this period is the amount by which :ref:`activeBlockCount` is allowed to increase before the redeem is considered to be expired. The period has an upper limit to ensure the user gets his BTC in time and to potentially punish a vault for inactivity or stealing BTC. Each redeem request records the value of this field upon creation, and when checking the expiry, the maximum of the current RedeemPeriod and the value as recorded in the RedeemRequest is used. This way, users are not negatively impacted by a change in the value.

.. _RedeemTransactionSize:

RedeemTransactionSize
.....................

The expected size in bytes of a redeem. This is used to set the bitcoin inclusion fee budget.

.. _RedeemBtcDustValue:

RedeemBtcDustValue
..................

The minimal amount in BTC a vault can be asked to transfer to the user. Note that this is not equal to the amount requests, since an inclusion fee is deducted from that amount.

Maps
----

RedeemRequests
...............

Users create redeem requests to receive BTC in return for interBTC. This mapping provides access from a unique hash ``redeemId`` to a ``Redeem`` struct. ``<redeemId, RedeemRequest>``.


Structs
-------

RedeemRequest
.............

Stores the status and information about a single redeem request.

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

.. _requestRedeem:

requestRedeem
--------------

A user requests to start the redeem procedure.
This function checks the BTC Parachain status in :ref:`security` and decides how the redeem process is to be executed. 
The following modes are possible:

* **Normal Redeem** - no errors detected, full BTC value is to be Redeemed. 
* **Premium Redeem** - the selected Vault's collateral rate has fallen below ``PremiumRedeemThreshold``. Full BTC value is to be redeemed, but the user is allocated a premium in DOT (``RedeemPremiumFee``), taken from the Vault's to-be-released collateral.

Specification
.............

*Function Signature*

``requestRedeem(redeemer, amountWrapped, btcAddress, vault)``

*Parameters*

* ``redeemer``: address of the user triggering the redeem.
* ``amountWrapped``: the amount of interBTC to destroy and BTC to receive.
* ``btcAddress``: the address to receive BTC.
* ``vault``: the vault selected for the redeem request.

*Returns*

* ``redeemId``: A unique hash identifying the redeem request.

*Events*

* :ref:`requestRedeemEvent`

*Preconditions*

Let ``burnedTokens`` be ``amountWrapped`` minus the result of the multiplication of :ref:`redeemFee` and ``amountWrapped``. Then:

* The function call MUST be signed by *redeemer*.
* The BTC Parachain status in the :ref:`security` component MUST be set to ``RUNNING:0``.

* The vault's ``issuedTokens`` MUST be at least ``vault.toBeRedeemedTokens + burnedTokens``.

*Postconditions*

Let ``burnedTokens`` be ``amountWrapped`` minus the result of the multiplication of :ref:`redeemFee` and ``amountWrapped``. Then:

* The vault's ``toBeRedeemedTokens`` MUST increase by ``burnedTokens``.
* ``amountWrapped`` of the redeemer's tokens MUST be locked by this transaction.
* :ref:`decreaseToBeReplacedTokens` MUST be called, supplying ``vault`` and ``burnedTokens``. The returned ``replaceCollateral`` MUST be released by this function.
* A new ``RedeemRequest`` MUST be added to the ``RedeemRequests`` map, with the following value:

   * ``redeem.vault`` MUST be the requested ``vault``
   * ``redeem.opentime`` MUST be the current :ref:`activeBlockCount`
   * ``redeem.fee`` MUST be :ref:`redeemFee` multiplied by ``amountWrapped`` if ``redeemer != vault``, otherwise this should be zero.

.. _liquidationRedeem:

liquidationRedeem
-----------------

A user executes a liquidation redeem that exchanges interBTC for collateral from the `LiquidationVault`. This function takes a ``currencyId`` argument that specifies which currency to the user wishes to receive. Since each currency uses a separate liquidation vault, the amount of collateral received depends only on the amount of tokens and collateral in that specific liquidation vault. If the user wants to obtain multiple currencies, they have to call this function multiple times, possibly through off-chain aggregation via batching. Since the 1:1 backing is being recovered in this function, interBTC is burned without releasing any BTC.  

Specification
.............

*Function Signature*

``liquidationRedeem(redeemer, amountWrapped, currencyId)``

*Parameters*

* ``redeemer``: address of the user triggering the redeem.
* ``amountWrapped``: the amount of interBTC to destroy.
* ``currencyId``: the currency id of the funds to be received.

*Events*

* :ref:`liquidationRedeemEvent`

*Preconditions*

* The BTC Parachain status in the :ref:`security` component MUST NOT be set to ``SHUTDOWN:2``.
* The function call MUST be signed.
* The redeemer MUST have at least ``amountWrapped`` free tokens.

*Postconditions*

* ``amountWrapped`` tokens MUST be burned from the user.
* :ref:`redeemTokensLiquidation` MUST be called with ``currency_id``, ``redeemer`` and ``amountWrapped`` as arguments.

.. _executeRedeem:

executeRedeem
-------------

A vault calls this function after receiving an ``RequestRedeem`` event with their public key. Before calling the function, the vault transfers the specific amount of BTC to the BTC address given in the original redeem request. The vault completes the redeem with this function.

Specification
.............

*Function Signature*

``executeRedeem(redeemId, rawMerkleProof, rawTx)``

*Parameters*

* ``redeemId``: the unique hash created during the ``requestRedeem`` function.
* ``rawMerkleProof``: Merkle tree path (concatenated LE SHA256 hashes).
* ``rawTx``: Raw Bitcoin transaction including the transaction inputs and outputs.


*Events*

* :ref:`executeRedeemEvent`

*Preconditions*

* The function call MUST be signed by *someone*, i.e. not necessarily the *vault*.
* The BTC Parachain status in the :ref:`security` component MUST NOT be set to ``SHUTDOWN:2``.
* A *pending* ``RedeemRequest`` MUST exist with an id equal to ``redeemId``.
* The ``rawTx`` MUST decode to a valid transaction that transfers exactly the amount specified in the ``RedeemRequest`` struct. It MUST be a transaction to the correct address, and provide the expected OP_RETURN, based on the ``RedeemRequest``.
* The ``rawMerkleProof`` MUST contain a valid proof of of ``rawTX``.
* The bitcoin payment MUST have been submitted to the relay chain, and MUST have sufficient confirmations.

*Postconditions*

* ``redeemRequest.amountBtc + redeemRequest.transferFeeBtc`` of the tokens in the redeemer's account MUST be burned.
* The user's `lockedTokens` MUST decrease by `redeemRequest.amountBtc + redeemRequest.transferFeeBtc`.
* The vault’s `toBeRedeemedTokens` MUST decrease by `redeemRequest.amountBtc + redeemRequest.transferFeeBtc`.
* The vault’s `issuedTokens` MUST decrease by `redeemRequest.amountBtc + redeemRequest.transferFeeBtc`.
* ``redeemRequest.fee`` MUST be unlocked and transferred from the redeemer's account to the fee pool.
* :ref:`redeemTokens` MUST be called, supplying ``redeemRequest.vault``, ``redeemRequest.amountBtc + redeemRequest.transferFeeBtc``, ``redeemRequest.premium`` and ``redeemRequest.redeemer`` as arguments.
* ``redeemRequest.status`` MUST be set to ``Completed``.


.. _cancelRedeem:

cancelRedeem
------------

If a redeem request is not completed on time, the redeem request can be cancelled.
The user that initially requested the redeem process calls this function to obtain the Vault's collateral as compensation for not refunding the BTC back to his address.

The failed vault is banned from further issue, redeem and replace requests for a pre-defined time period (:ref:`punishmentDelay` as defined in :ref:`vault-registry`).

The user is able to choose between reimbursement and retrying. If the user chooses the retry, it gets back the tokens, and a punishment fee is transferred from the vault to the user. If the user chooses reimbursement, then they receive the equivalent worth of the tokens in collateral, plus a punishment fee. In this case, the tokens are transferred from the user to the vault. In either case, the vault may also be slashed an additional punishment that goes to the fee pool.

The punishment fee paid to the user stays constant (i.e., the user always receives the punishment fee of e.g. 10%).

*Function Signature*

``cancelRedeem(redeemer, redeemId, reimburse)``

*Parameters*

* ``redeemer``: account cancelling this redeem request.
* ``redeemId``: the unique hash of the redeem request.

*Events*

* :ref:`cancelRedeemEvent`

*Preconditions*

* The function call MUST be signed by ``redeemer``.
* The BTC Parachain status in the :ref:`security` component MUST be set to ``RUNNING:0``.

Let ``confiscatedCollateral`` be equal to ``vault.backingCollateral * (amountIncludingParachainFee / vault.toBeRedeemedTokens)``.
Then:

* If the vault is liquidated:

   * If ``reimburse`` is true, an amount of ``confiscatedCollateral`` MUST be transferred from the vault to the redeemer.
   * If ``reimburse`` is false, an amount of ``confiscatedCollateral`` MUST be transferred from the vault to the liquidation vault.

* If the vault is *not* liquidated, the following collateral changes are made:

   * If ``reimburse`` is true, the user SHOULD be reimbursed the worth of ``amountIncludingParachainFee`` in collateral. The transfer MUST be saturating, i.e. if the amount is not available, it should transfer whatever amount *is* available.
   * A punishment fee MUST be tranferred from the vault's backing collateral to the redeemer: :ref:`punishmentFee`. The transfer MUST be saturating, i.e. if the amount is not available, it should transfer whatever amount *is* available.

* If ``reimburse`` is true:

   * ``redeem.fee`` MUST be transferred from the vault to the fee pool if non-zero.
   * If after the loss of collateral the vault is below the :ref:`SecureCollateralThreshold`:

      *  ``amountIncludingParachainFee`` of the user's tokens are *burned*. 
      * :ref:`decreaseTokens` MUST be called, supplying the vault, the user, and ``amountIncludingParachainFee`` as arguments. 
      *  The ``redeem.status`` is set to ``Reimbursed(false)``, where the ``false`` indicates that the vault has not yet received the tokens.

   * If after the loss of collateral the vault remains above the :ref:`SecureCollateralThreshold`:

      * ``amountIncludingParachainFee`` of the user's tokens MUST be unlocked and transferred to the vault. 
      * :ref:`decreaseToBeRedeemedTokens` MUST be called, supplying the vault and ``amountIncludingParachainFee`` as arguments. 
      * The ``redeem.status`` is set to ``Reimbursed(true)``, where the ``true`` indicates that the vault has received the tokens.

* If ``reimburse`` is false:

   * All the user's tokens that were locked in :ref:`requestRedeem` MUST be unlocked, i.e. an amount of ``redeem.amountBtc + redeem.fee + redeem.transferFeeBtc``.
   * The vault's ``toBeRedeemedTokens`` MUST decrease by ``amountIncludingParachainFee``.

* The vault MUST be banned.



.. _mintTokensForReimbursedRedeem:

mintTokensForReimbursedRedeem
