Vault Registry
==============

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The vault registry is the central place to manage vaults. Vaults can register themselves here, update their collateral, or can be liquidated.
Similarly, the issue, redeem, refund, and replace protocols call this module to assign vaults during issue, redeem, refund, and replace procedures.
Moreover, vaults use the registry to register public key for the :ref:`okd` and register addresses for the :ref:`op-return` scheme.

.. _vault_registry_overview_multi_collateral:

Multi-Collateral
----------------

The parachain supports the usage of different currencies for usage as collateral. Which currencies are allowed is determined by governance - they have to explicitly white-list currencies to be able to be used as collateral. They also have to set the various safety thresholds for each currency. 

Vaults in the system are identified by a VaultId, which is essentially a (AccountId, CollateralCurrency, WrappedCurrency) tuple. Note the distinction between the AccountId and the VaultId. A vault operator can run multiple vaults using a the same AccountId but different collateral currencies (and thus VaultIds). Each vault is isolated from all others. This means that if vault operator has two running vaults using the same AccountId but different CollateralCurrencies, then if one of the vaults were to get liquidated, the other vaults remains untouched. The vault client manages all VaultIds associated with a given AccountId. Vault operators will be able to register new VaultIds through the UI, and the vault client will automatically start to manage these.

When a user requests an issue, it selects a single vault to issue with (this choice may be made automatically by the UI). However, since the wrapped token is fully fungible, it may be redeemed with any vault, even if that vault is using a different collateral currency. When redeeming, the user again selects a single vault to redeem with. If a vault fails to execute a redeem request, the user is able to either get back its wrapped token, or to get reimbursed in the vault's collateral currency. If the user prefers the latter, the choice of vault becomes relevant because it determines which currency is received in case of failure.

The WrappedCurrency part of the VaultId is currently always required to take the same value - in the future support for different wrapped currencies may be added.

Moreover, the system implements a ceiling for the maximum amount of collateral than can be locked in the system per collateral and wrapped token pair. Governance is able to update the collateral ceilings.

.. note:: Please note that multi-collateral is a recent addition to the code, and the spec has not been fully updated .

.. _punishmentDelay:

PunishmentDelay
...............

Time period in which a Vault cannot participate in issue, redeem or replace requests.

- Measured in Parachain blocks
- Initial value: 1 day (Parachain constant)

LiquidationVaultAccountId
.........................

Account identifier of an artificial vault maintained by the VaultRegistry to handle interBTC balances and DOT collateral of liquidated Vaults. That is, when a vault is liquidated, its balances are transferred to ``LiquidationVaultAccountId`` and claims are later handled via the ``LiquidationVault``.

Maps
----

.. _LiquidationVault:

LiquidationVault
................

Mapping from ``CurrencyId`` to the account identifier of an artificial vault (see :ref:`SystemVault`) maintained by the VaultRegistry to handle interBTC balances and collateral of liquidated Vaults that use the given currency. That is, when a vault is liquidated, its balances are transferred to ``LiquidationVault`` and claims are later handled via the ``LiquidationVault``.


.. note:: A Vault's token balances and collateral are transferred to the ``LiquidationVault`` as a result of automated liquidations and :ref:`relay_function_report_vault_theft`.


MinimumCollateralVault
......................

Mapping from ``CurrencyId`` to the minimum collateral a vault needs to provide to register. 

.. note:: This is a protection against spamming the protocol with very small collateral amounts. Vaults are still able to withdraw the collateral after registration, but at least it requires an additional transaction fee, and it provides protection against accidental registration with very low amounts of collateral.


.. _SecureCollateralThreshold:

SecureCollateralThreshold
.........................

Mapping from ``CurrencyId`` to to the over-collateralization rate for collateral locked by Vaults, necessary for issuing tokens. 

The Vault can take on issue requests depending on the collateral it provides and under consideration of the ``SecureCollateralThreshold``.
The maximum amount of interBTC a vault is able to support during the issue process is based on the following equation:

:math:`\text{max(interBTC)} = \text{collateral} * \text{ExchangeRate} / \text{SecureCollateralThreshold}`.

* The Secure Collateral Threshold MUST be greater than the Liquidation Threshold.
* The Secure Collateral Threshold MUST be greater than the Premium Redeem Threshold.

.. note:: As an example, assume we use ``DOT`` as collateral, we issue ``interBTC`` and lock ``BTC`` on the Bitcoin side. Let's assume the ``BTC``/``DOT`` exchange rate is ``80``, i.e., one has to pay 80 ``DOT`` to receive 1 ``BTC``. Further, the ``SecureCollateralThreshold`` is 200%, i.e., a vault has to provide two-times the amount of collateral to back an issue request. Now let's say the vault deposits 400 ``DOT`` as collateral. Then this vault can back at most 2.5 interBTC as: :math:`400 * (1/80) / 2 = 2.5`.


.. _PremiumCollateralThreshold:

PremiumRedeemThreshold
......................

Mapping from ``CurrencyId`` to the the collateral rate of Vaults, at which users receive a premium, allocated from the Vault's collateral, when performing a :ref:`redeem-protocol` with this Vault. 

* The Premium Redeem Threshold MUST be greater than the Liquidation Threshold.

.. _LiquidationThreshold:

LiquidationThreshold
....................

Mapping from ``CurrencyId`` to the lower bound for the collateral rate in issued tokens. If a Vaultâ€™s collateral rate drops below this, automatic liquidation is triggered.

* The Liquidation Threshold MUST be greater than 100% for any collateral asset.

.. _vault_registry_map_system_collateral_ceiling:

SystemCollateralCeiling
.......................

Mapping from a collateral ``CurrencyId`` to a wrapped ``CurrencyId``. Determines the maximum amount of collateral that Vaults are able to lock for backing a wrapped asset.

.. _vaults:

Vaults
......

Mapping from accounts of Vaults to their struct. ``<Account, Vault>``.

=========================  ==================  ========================================================
``wallet``                 Wallet<BtcAddress>  A set of Bitcoin address(es) of this vault, used for theft detection. Additionally, it contains the btcPublicKey used for generating deposit addresses in the issue process.

``currencyId``             CurrencyId          The currency the vault uses for collateral
=========================  ==================  ========================================================

.. note:: This specification currently assumes for simplicity that a vault will reuse the same BTC address, even after multiple redeem requests. **[Future Extension]**: For better security, Vaults may desire to generate new BTC addresses each time they execute a redeem request. This can be handled by pre-generating multiple BTC addresses and storing these in a list for each Vault. Caution is necessary for users which execute issue requests with "old" vault addresses - these BTC must be moved to the latest address by Vaults.

.. note:: If a vault successfully executes a replace after having been liquidated, it receives some of its confiscated collateral back.

.. _getMaxNominationRatio:

getMaxNominationRatio
----------------------

Returns the nomination ratio, denoting the maximum amount of collateral that can be nominated in a given currency.

- ``MaxNominationRatio = (SecureCollateralThreshold / PremiumRedeemThreshold) - 1)``

*Example*

- ``SecureCollateralThreshold = 1.5 (150%)``
- ``PremiumRedeemThreshold = 1.2 (120%)``
- ``MaxNominationRatio = (1.5 / 1.2) - 1 = 0.25 (25%)``

In this example, a Vault with 10 DOT locked as collateral can only receive 2.5 DOT through nomination.
