Governance
==========

Overview
~~~~~~~~

On-chain governance is useful for controlling system parameters, authorizing trusted oracles and upgrading the core protocols. The architecture adopted by interBTC is modelled on Polkadot with some significant changes:

- **Optimistic Governance**
    - No **Council**, only public proposals from community
    - Community can elect a **Technical Committee** to fast-track proposals
    - Referenda are Super-Majority Against (Negative Turnout Bias) by default

- **Stake-To-Vote**
    - Adopted from Curve's governance model
    - Users lock the native governance token
    - Longer lockups give more voting power

An important distinction is the ``negative turnout bias`` (Super-Majority Against) voting threshold. This is best summarized by the `Polkadot <https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance>`_ docs:

A heavy super-majority of nay votes is required to reject at low turnouts, but as turnout increases towards 100%, it becomes a simple majority-carries as below.

.. math:: \frac{\text{against}}{\sqrt{\text{electorate}}} < \frac{\text{approve}}{\sqrt{\text{turnout}}}

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Proposals** are community-supported motions to perform system-level actions.
- **Referenda** are accepted proposals undergoing voting.

Processes
~~~~~~~~~

Proposals
---------

1. Account submits public proposal with deposit (``> MinimumDeposit``)
2. Account "seconds" proposal with additional deposit
3. New referenda are started every ``LaunchPeriod``
4. Community can vote on referenda for the ``VotingPeriod``
5. Votes are tallied after ``VotingPeriod`` expires
6. System update executed after ``EnactmentPeriod``

Technical Committee
-------------------

1. Community creates proposal as above
2. TC may fast track before ``LaunchPeriod``
3. The new referendum is started immediately
4. Community can vote on referenda for the ``FastTrackVotingPeriod``
