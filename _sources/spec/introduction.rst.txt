How to Read This Specification
==============================

This specification is a living document. The actual implementation might deviate from the specification. In case of deviations in the code, the code has priority over the specification.

External Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Public functions called by users of the platform - most calls are assumed to be signed by an account able to pay the transaction fees.


Internal Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Private functions called by block construction hooks or other external functions.


Preconditions, Postconditions and Invariants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Preconditions are condition that must hold before the function is executed. Unless otherwise stated, if the precondition does not hold, the function MUST return an error. If the function is external (i.e. callable by users), then if the function returns an error, it MUST NOT make any changes to the storage. The postconditions describe the changes the function MAY make to the storage. Additionally, it describes the return value of the function, if any.
Invariants describe conditions that must hold both before and after the execution, but the function might not check whether the invariant holds prior to execution if the code assures that it always holds.


Errors and Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Error listed in the function specification are not necessarily exhaustive - a function MAY return errors not listed. Similarly, events listed in the function specification are not necessarily exhaustive - a function MAY emit other events.
