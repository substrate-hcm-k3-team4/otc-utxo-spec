.. _security:

Security
========

The Security module is responsible for (1) tracking the status of the BTC Parachain, (2) the "active" blocks of the BTC Parachain, and (3) generating secure identifiers.

1. **Status**: The BTC Parachain has three distinct states: ``Running``, ``Error``, and ``Shutdown`` which determine which functions can be used.
2. **Active Blocks**: When the BTC Parachain is not in the ``Running`` state, certain operations are restricted. In order to prevent impact on the users and Vaults for the core issue, redeem, and replace operations, the BTC Parachain only considers Active Blocks for the Issue, Redeem, and Replace periods.
3. **Secure Identifiers**: As part of the :ref:`op-return` scheme to prevent replay attacks, the security module generates unique identifiers that are used to identify transactions. 

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Failure Modes
-------------

The BTC Parachain can enter into an ERROR and SHUTDOWN state, depending on the occurred error.
An overview is provided in the figure below.

    :alt: State machine showing BTC Parachain failure modes

    (Informal) State machine showing the operational and failure modes and how to recover from or flag failures.


Failure handling methods calls are **restricted**, i.e., can only be called by pre-determined roles.

.. _oracle-offline-err:

Oracle Offline
--------------

The :ref:`oracle` experienced a liveness failure (no up-to-date exchange rate available).
The frequency of the oracle updates is defined in the Oracle module.

**Error code:** ``ORACLE_OFFLINE``


Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~

Enums
-----

.. _statusCode:

StatusCode
...........
Indicates ths status of the BTC Parachain.

* ``RUNNING: 0`` - BTC Parachain fully operational

* ``ERROR: 1``- an error was detected in the BTC Parachain. See ``Errors`` for more details, i.e., the specific error codes (these determine how to react).

* ``SHUTDOWN: 2`` - BTC Parachain operation fully suspended. This can only be achieved via manual intervention by the Governance Mechanism.

.. _errorCode:

ErrorCode
.........

Enum specifying error codes tracked in ``Errors``.


* ``NONE: 0``

* ``ORACLE_OFFLINE: 1``


Data Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scalars
--------

ParachainStatus
...............

Stores the status code (:ref:`statusCode`) which defines the current state of the BTC Parachain. 


Errors
......

Stores the set of error codes (:ref:`errorCode`), indicating the reason for the error.


Nonce
.....

Integer increment-only counter, used to prevent collisions when generating identifiers for e.g., redeem or replace requests (for OP_RETURN field in Bitcoin).


.. _activeBlockCount:

ActiveBlockCount
................

A counter variable that increments every block when the parachain status is ``RUNNING:0``. This variable is used to keep track of durations, such as issue/redeem/replace expiry.
This is used instead of the block number because if the parachain status is not ``RUNNING:0``, no payment proofs can be submitted, so it would not be fair towards users and Vaults to continue counting down the (expiry) periods.
This field MUST be set to the current block height on initialization.


Functions
~~~~~~~~~

.. _generateSecureId:

generateSecureId
----------------

Generates a unique ID using an account identifier, the ``Nonce`` and a random seed.

Specification
.............

*Function Signature*

``generateSecureId(account)``

*Parameters*

* ``account``: account identifier (links this identifier to the AccountId associated with the process where this secure id is to be used, e.g., the user calling :ref:`requestIssue`).

*Preconditions*

* A parent block MUST exist (cannot be called on the parachain genesis block).

*Postconditions*

* Nonce MUST be incremented by one.
* MUST return the 256-bit hash of the ``account`, ``nonce``, and ``parent_hash`` (the hash of the previous block of this transaction).


.. _hasExpired:

hasExpired
----------

Checks if the ``period`` has expired since the ``opentime``. This calculation is based on the :ref:`activeBlockCount`.

Specification
.............

*Function Signature*

``hasExpired(opentime, period)``

*Parameters*

* ``opentime``: the :ref:`activeBlockCount` at the time the issue/redeem/replace was opened.
* ``period``: the number of blocks the user or Vault has to complete the action.

*Preconditions*

* The `ActiveBlockCount` MUST be greater than 0.

*Postconditions*

* MUST return ``True`` if ``opentime + period < ActiveBlockCount``, ``False`` otherwise.


.. _setParachainStatus:

setParachainStatus
------------------

Governance sets a status code for the BTC Parachain manually.

Specification
.............

*Function Signature*

``setParachainStatus(StatusCode)``

*Parameters*

* ``StatusCode``: the new StatusCode of the BTC-Parachain.

.. _insertParachainError:

insertParachainError
--------------------

Governance inserts an error for the BTC Parachain manually.

Specification
.............

*Function Signature*

``insertParachainError(ErrorCode)``

*Parameters*

* ``ErrorCode``: the ErrorCode to be added to the set of errors of the BTC-Parachain.

.. _removeParachainError:

removeParachainError
--------------------

Governance removes an error for the BTC Parachain manually.

Specification
.............

*Function Signature*

``removeParachainError(ErrorCode)``

*Parameters*

* ``ErrorCode``: the ErrorCode to be removed from the set of errors of the BTC-Parachain.


Events
~~~~~~~

RecoverFromErrors
-----------------

*Event Signature*

``RecoverFromErrors(StatusCode, ErrorCode[])``

*Parameters*

* ``StatusCode``: the new StatusCode of the BTC Parachain
* ``ErrorCode[]``: the list of current errors
